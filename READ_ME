NEO CRED - Machine Learning Module
Overview
The NEO CRED ML module is designed to predict loan eligibility & assess financial risk using AI-driven credit scoring models. The system leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enhance privacy, Explainable AI (XAI) for transparency, and deep learning models to evaluate financial health.

Key Features
✅ AI-Powered Credit Scoring
Uses spending behavior, income trends, and transaction patterns to generate a risk score (0-100).
Categorizes users into Very Risky, Medium Risk, and Safe for loan approval.
✅ Federated Learning for Privacy
Instead of sharing raw financial data, only model updates are sent to a centralized FL server.
Helps in decentralized learning while maintaining user privacy.
✅ Explainable AI (XAI) for Transparency
SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain loan decisions.
Users & banks can see why a loan was approved/rejected.
✅ AI-Powered Smart Loan Adjustments
Dynamic credit limit adjustments based on user spending behavior.
Early warnings for high-risk borrowers to prevent loan defaults.
Model Pipeline
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Extracts credit, debit, balance, & transaction frequency from bank statements.
Normalizes & encodes categorical data for AI training.
2️⃣ Federated Learning-Based Model Training

Uses a deep learning model (MLP - Multi-layer Perceptron) trained with FL clients.
FL clients send local model updates instead of user data.
3️⃣ Risk Scoring & Loan Eligibility Classification

Generates a Risk Score (0-100) using AI models.
Uses softmax classification to determine loan approval categories.
4️⃣ Explainability Layer (SHAP & LIME)

Generates SHAP importance plots to explain AI decisions.
Uses LIME to generate human-readable explanations for loan officers & users.
Performance Metrics
Accuracy: 72%
Precision: Weighted precision for loan eligibility
Recall: Identifies high-risk users correctly
F1-Score: Balances precision & recall for reliable predictions
